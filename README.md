This repository provides supplementary materials for the paper entitled 'Convolutional neural networks for mapping alteration zones using remote sensing data'. This paper proposes a framework for alteration mapping using convolutional neural networks and compares the results to support vector machine and multilayer perceptron. This framework is applied to three different data types, including Landsat 8, Landsat 9, and ASTER.
