# Convolutional Neural Networks for Alteration Mapping

This repository provides supplementary materials for the paper entitled 'Convolutional neural networks for mapping alteration zones using remote sensing data'. This paper proposes a framework for alteration mapping using convolutional neural networks and compares the results to multilayer perceptron. This framework is applied to three different data types, including Landsat 8, Landsat 9, and ASTER.
